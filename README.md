Whac-a-mole game that I created from scratch, without referring to code-alongs. It is a simple game for now, but I 
plan to implement more features and improvements such as: 

1. A timer that counts down from a certain number of seconds, and ends the game when the timer reaches 0. (COMPLETED)



Any comments on how to improve my code is greatly appreciated!!
