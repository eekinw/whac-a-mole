Whac-a-mole game that I created from scratch, without referring to code-alongs. It is a simple game for now, but I 
plan to implement more features and improvements such as: 

1. A timer that counts down from a certain number of seconds, and ends the game when the timer reaches 0. (COMPLETED)
2. A difficulty setting that allows the user to choose the speed at which the mole appears and disappears.
3. Sound effects that play when the mole is hit or missed.


Any comments on how to improve my code is greatly appreciated!!
